AUTOMATIC ANIMATION SUGGESTIONS
Based on your surroundings, the server will automatically recommend an animation you can perform. If you're standing near a wall, ledge, or near the engine of a car, simply press - to activate the animation automatically. The suggestion will change based on your surroundings such as a car doing burnouts or if you're at the strip club.

CHECKPOINT
A checkpoint for our Whitelisted LEO has been added near Los Santos Freeway, adding a new experience for cops & civilians who pass through this new checkpoint.

DRUG LABS
We have added back both the meth lab and weed factory near Blaine County & Los Santos. Both of these can be found on the map and feature secret escape tunnels.

Misc Improvements
SADOT has brand new clothing
Our trailer scripts have been updated to perform better and have less bugs.

A second update may come out this month that will feature a new town hall in Blaine County, and more! Please be patient with all the new assets loading, your games will take a few minutes to load before cars and uniforms load.
