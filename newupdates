- Speed Enforcement Revamp
We now have 3 new speed enforcement vehicles that feature liveries for every department, custom handlings, custom engine sounds, and more. These are faster, higher quality, and better for chases. 

- Spike Strips Revamp
Spike strips have undergone a major revamp. The script now features FPS improvements, auto-deletion, new animations, cleaner prompts & UI, and more. To activate spikes, type /spikes at the trunk of a police vehicle, and you will automatically equip them.

- Jailing Improvements
If a player attempts to leave and rejoin the server to avoid jail time, the server will place them back into jail to finish the time. (Staff & LEO jailing)
Staff jailing no longer requires input for time. Staff must type /staffjail (id), and the server will place them in jail for 10 minutes. 

- Take Hostage
Enhanced Civilians can now take other players hostage by using the "Take Hostage" button in the F5 menu.

- Shooting While Driving
From now on, only players with the Certified Civilian rank can shoot out of a vehicle. A notification will display if a player attempts to shoot without having this rank.

- Misc Bug Fixes
Tactical Weapons Pack 1 now has a new weapon, the CZ75. This replaces the broken banshee.
Mobile Spikes for LEO now have a 100% success rate.
Car clear notifications will now appear if a car clear was done near you.
