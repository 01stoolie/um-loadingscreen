MARCH CONTENT UPDATE

Our 1st March content update is now out! For this month's update, we have focused on enhancing our scripts and providing a better roleplay experience. 

NEW Emotes Menu
Now in-game, PSRP features a brand new emotes menu. This menu now features a modern UI, hundreds more emotes, props, and walking styles. You can also search for certain animations and set keybinds for specific emotes within the menu.

NEW Fire Script & Hose
Our SAFR has received a new fire script and hose that is much lighter on our server and includes more features. The fire script includes much better fire and smoke animations. Additionally, the hose now has a foam and pressure feature creating a much more in-depth experience.

NEW LEO Helicam
After nearly a year, our LEO helicopter has a brand new helicam. This new helicam features a new UI, vehicle & player tracking, license plate readers, an improved spotlight, and a revamped rappelling feature.

Taser Effect
Previously, when a player was tased, they could get back up after 3 seconds, and the roleplay was not in-depth. Tasers will give a new realistic animation and cause players to stay on the ground for about 10 seconds. The new animation prevents players from running immediately after getting tased and provides a much more realistic experience.

Crawling Mode
Now in-game, players can use our brand crawl mode! Simply configure the crawl feature in your FiveM keybinds and you can crawl using that keybind. Players cannot shoot while crawling to ensure this feature cannot be exploited.

Custom Gift Cards
Now on the PSRP store, custom gift cards can be created! Custom gift cards have been a heavily requested feature, so players can now feature a gift card of any amount using our store's custom gift card package. Simply type in a custom amount, and a gift card of the same value will be sent after purchase. https://psrp.tebex.io
