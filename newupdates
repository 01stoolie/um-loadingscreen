HALLOWEEN DECORATIONS
Near Legion Square, we have added Halloween decorations! We have also added decorations at the graveyard and legion garage. 

SANDY PD REMOVAL - GRAPESEED ADDITION
We have removed the police station in Sandy Shores and have added one in Grapeseed. This drastically improves FPS and allows our <@&848700639097782272> to patrol in Blaine County with less chaos. 

BLAINE COUNTY PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS
For the first time ever, Sandy Shores & Paleto Bay are now lag-free. We have removed several maps causing FPS drops, such as the Sandy PD, Paleto FD, etc., to bring 30-50 more FPS when roleplaying in these areas. 

SANDY & PALETO MOTELS
With these performance improvements, we have added two highly requested maps. Sandy Shores and Paleto Bay now feature an interior to the motels. With over 50 rooms in Sandy and 20+ in Paleto, there is plenty of roleplay.

2 NEW MAPS
We have added two brand new maps in Los Santos. The Koi restaurant and a recording studio have been added at postals 695 and 603. Both of these maps feature in-depth interiors to bring more roleplay opportunities.
