Caching
- We're now using cache within the UI, meaning the amount of server events / callbacks will be reduced by at least 90%.
- This is something we'll keep on using & implementing on other places as time goes by. 

State System
- Most of the Phone UI Functionality has been re-written to make it more optimized, you should be able to realize a big difference on the UI performance now, and it should be even smoother than before!

Input
- Re-wrote the input system, you should now be able to use text fields etc again without having those keys being active in the game, way more accurate then before too.

Instagram
- Fixed a rare bug that would need reopening the Instagram app in order to edit your profile. 
- Fixed a bug that would cause a 0 to appear on profiles when they had no story.

Camera
-  Flipping to selfie camera in a vehicle now works.

Twitter
- You can now unpin tweets!

Screenshots
- Taking screenshots now works again, broke after last update.

Other
- Fixed a bug that would cause notifications to be blurry
- Improved UI in the Settings app.
- New Animation when opening apps, they'll now open from the app location.
- Fixed a bug that would cause the phone not going to the lock screen when closing it.
- Other optimizations & tweaks.
