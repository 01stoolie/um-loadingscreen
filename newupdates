- F9 Vehicle Spawner Revamp
The F9 vehicle spawner menu now features a new interface! This new interface fixes the issue where you would open a category and a completely different one would display. This new UI will soon be featured in our /keys menu.

- Spawn Selector Locations
The spawn selector now features brand new locations! After nearly 6+ months, we have brought new locations now including a Paleto Bay spawn point.

- Traction Control
You can now disable the traction control on any vehicle by typing **/tc** in chat. This will allow your vehicle to drift much better at lower speeds. 

- Door Chime
A brand new door chime sound has been added. The new sound now features a 2020+ ford chime. The volume on this chime will be increased next server restart.

- Pitstop Garage Removal
The pitstop garage located in Los Santos has been removed. This area was under-utilized and caused FPS drops when near it.
