SAST Revamp
Our very own @PSRP | SAST has gotten a major revamp that includes brand NEW liveries for the entire department! This revamp has been in the making for nearly 3 months and is now in-game.

NEW Los Santos Customs Interior
The Los Santos Customs shop at postal 627 now has an interior for the mechanic shop, a store, and a hidden shop in the back! This is our most in-depth mechanic shop on the server, so stop by!

NEW Pitstop Garage Addition
The newly added Pitstop Garage is now in-game at postal 796. It includes a shop inside, an outdoor parking lot designed for car meets, and a drifting area! 

Discord Permissions Refresh Command
PSRP now has an in-game command that allows you to refresh your permissions so that you no longer need to relog after getting a new role. Simply type /refreshperms and the server will automatically assign your newly added permissions. Chat roles are also connected to this command. You no longer need to wait for a server to restart!

Server Asset Optimization
We have gone through 85% of our oversized assets and optimized them to decrease lag and FPS drops when playing. The most noticeable areas will include LEO vehicles, which have dropped by nearly 50%-75% of the original size. @PSRP | Whitelisted LEO vehicles are now 1080p instead of 1440p bringing much higher frames. 

Misc Changes
- Phone UI has been improved so that only installed apps will run. This will make the UI smoother.
- Our passive mode script has been revamped. Players in passive mode will display "PASSIVE" above their heads to prevent false "god mode" reports.
- A sling has been added for heavy weapons. Simply type /sling when the gun is on your back.
- A newly added gas station script has been added to decrease overall strain on the server.
- Tackling now has a cooldown to prevent players from spamming it.
- Various peds have been optimized. 

That is all for this week's update; thank you so much for supporting PSRP and allowing us to continue bringing new and improved updates. Make sure to hop in-game and try out all these newly added features!
