CASINO
For the first time, PSRP now features a working casino! This casino is very similar to the GTA online version, but features a custom interior, drinking script at the bar, working elevator for penthouses, and much more! You have chips that you can bet that act as the currently inside the casino. 

DRINKING SCRIPT
A functional drinking script is now located at the casino bar! This drinking script has realistic effects such as passing out, puking, drunk driving, and more! This is only located at the casino for now and will be added into other areas in the future.

REVAMPED POLICE STATIONS
All police stations in-game have been revamped! These new stations are now lighter on your game, feature realistic interiors and more. Now, the Mission Row, Grapeseed, and Paleto stations allow civilians to walk inside the lobby to speak to officers/make reports. The lobbies were previously locked, but you can now enter and speak to officers.

SANDY SHORES REVAMP
Sandy is typically filled with trolls, so we've decided to revamp it and bring new interiors! Now, there is a burger shot, clinic center, bank, law office, liquor store, & motel exterior revamp! Now, you're able to roleplay in different locations, encouraging in-depth roleplay to cut down on the trolls.

SEWER TUNNELS
A sewer network is now in-game near grove! There are currently 2 blip markers where you can enter the sewer that leads into a central network with a massive interior! This area is great if you're looking to explore and create scenes underground.
