In just under a month since our last content update, we've got another one! This update focuses on the quality of roleplay along with the addition of a few maps to help bring more scenes into Vinewood and other places. 

ANTI-VDM WITH AUTO PASSIVE
After a ‚Å†community vote, we have now added an auto-passive system that forces players who are not in the Discord or not a Cert-Civ/LEO into passive mode once they reach speeds high enough to VDM. This does not limit the speed of vehicles or impact the roleplay since police cannot pit vehicles past 45mph. Once the player is no longer at such speeds, the auto-passive is disabled.

SIT ANYWHERE
We have improved our sitting script, allowing players to sit on any chair, bench, or bed, that is a GTA model. This allows players to naturally sit in chairs instead of having to constantly do an emote to get in a chair. 

3 NEW MAPS
We have added 3 new maps that bring roleplay into Vinewood and Harmony featuring blips on the map. Below you'll find a list of the map & it's location.
