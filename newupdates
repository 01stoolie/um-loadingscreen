Revamped Safe Zones
Our safe zones have been rebuilt from the ground up. Now, they will automatically put you into passive mode and disable it once you leave the zone. This eliminates VDM from safe zones and allows players to relax.

Sandy-Paleto Bridge
A brand new bridge has been added that connects Sandy and Paleto Bay! This bridge is great for players looking to race or simply get to Paleto faster.

Police Shields
After months and months of requests, we have finally added a brand new police shield for our LEO. This shield covers the officer's entire body and enhances roleplay where officers need to breach.

Revamped Taser
Our police taser has been revamped for the first time. This new taser features a flashlight, UI, the ability to reload via a keybind, sound effects, and more! This new taser brings enhanced combat for our officers.

Realistic Weapon Wheel Icons
We have added realistic weapon wheel icons after a ‚Å†community vote. These new icons display realistic weapons and bring a realistic feel to combat.

Revamped Police & Gang Blips
For the first time ever, our gangs now have access to blips designed for their own gangs! We have also revamped our police blips from the ground up, allowing officers to view the direction an officer is facing, and their location regardless of how far away they are, smoother updates when moving and more.
